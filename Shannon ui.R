It is also known as a measure of uncertainty, because it relates the uncertainty of an event to the gain of the information received. The maximum amount of information is gained when the certainty of a given unit is minimal, namely at 0.5 or 50% for a dichotomous outcome (yes, no). The more certain the occurrence of the next unit becomes, whether it is more likely or less likely, the lower the information content. Data on a nominal level of measurement are used for the Shannon index."),

               p("The Shannon index can be interpreted as the average number of \u0022yes/no\u0022-questions that must be asked to determine to which component a randomly selected unit of the distribution belongs to (for log2). For example, a string consisting only of \u0027A\u0027s would result in a Shannon index of 0 because every letter is an \u0027A\u0027. The \u0027event\u0027 of having an \u0027A\u0027 on every position is 100%. In contrast, a string with evenly distributed letters like \u0027ABCD\u0027 would result in a Shannon index of 2, because two questions would be sufficient to determine each letter (i.e., question 1: \u0022AB or CD?\u0022; question 2: \u0022A or B?\u0022 or, equivalently, \u0022C or D?\u0022). Doubling each letter (AABBCCDD) would result in the same Shannon index as \u0027ABCD\u0027. Null entries are ignored by the formula."),
